Splitscreen handlers and game mods for NucleusCoop

How to use latest Black Ops 1 handler:

1. Download files from:
https://github.com/zoro-io/NucleusCoop

2. Extract the archive and place the mods and folder inside your NucleusApp\NucleusCo-op folder.

Open the extracted handlers folder, there will be two folders - Multiplayer and Zombies. Copy the **Contents** of these folders to the handlers folder within your NucleusApp\NucleusCo-op folder.  If you have used nucleus before you will already have some game handlers here. It should look like the attached image after you've added it.

3. Open Nucleus. Select "Search Game" at the top, and point to both the BlackOps.exe and BlackOpsMP.exe files. This will add both game handlers into Nucleus.

**The following instructions are just for Zombies as this is all I have managed to get working.**

4. Run Nucleus as admin. Select the Zombies handler and allocate screens and controllers, then hit the arrow in the top right and hit play.

5. A prompt will appear asking for the IP of the host machine. If you are playing local splitscreen, or this machine will be the host, hit OK. The first window will launch, and a process picker will appear. For the first window, select "server". The second window will launch and a process picker will appear, select Player 2. 

You should have two windows at the BO1 start screen. The BO1 menus don't support controllers, so a keyboard will have to be used to select the Zombies option. I found I was able to Alt+Tab to each window in turn and select the required options.
For me this has been Zombies > Online > Find Match > Select Map. This places you in a lobby, and once you've also done it on your second instance you will be able to see each other in the same lobby and can start the game. 

Once in game, if you are unable to move using the controllers, hit the "end" key on the keyboard.

This should allow you to get into a game using the handlers developed by Zoro and Potatato302. If I can get MP working I will produce similar guidance for that.
